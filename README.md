## üîé How the App Works

The app is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. Here's how users interact with it:

1. **User Authentication**  
   New users can register with their name, email, and password. Returning users can log in securely.

2. **Browsing Recipes**  
   Once logged in, users land on a home screen listing meals. Each card shows the meal name, category, and origin.

3. **Recipe Details**  
   Tapping a meal opens a detailed view, including ingredients, instructions, and an image. Users can favorite the recipe from here.

4. **Search Functionality**  
   The search tab allows users to filter meals by name in real time using TheMealDB API.

5. **Favorites Management**  
   Users can mark meals as favorites and revisit them anytime from the favorites tab even offline.

6. **Drawer Menu**  
   Includes options for logging out or deleting the account.
